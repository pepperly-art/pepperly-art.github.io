# pepperly-art.github.io

This website makes use of tooling from [Twind](https://craigerskine.github.io/11ty-twind/). In total, I use [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Iconify](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/).

My intent is to just hop into the main commission list json to add data as I need to, and then push to github, without having to deal with any outside websites, finicky logins, or whatever else.

If you're a fellow artist and want to use this setup as your own Trello replacement, feel free to clone this and mess around with it. All important data is located in commlist.json and site.yaml and you shouldn't need to mess with anything else to just track. 

Features: Non-javascript lightbox, light/dark mode, mobile responsiveness, one json that does ALL THE WORK.
